## Portfolio 2025

This project will serve as my portfolio website for 2025 and the forseeable future.<br>

As it stands, my current portfolio website is barebones and out of date; not able to compete with the rest of the industry.<br>
Therefor, a project to revamp my portfolio website is needed and thus, here you are reading this :)
