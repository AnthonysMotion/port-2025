## Portfolio 2025

This project will serve as my portfolio website for 2025 and the forseeable future.<br>

As it stands, my current portfolio website is barebones and out of date, unable to compete with the rest of the industry. It lacks the dynamic features and aesthetic appeal that potential clients and employers expect in todayâ€™s digital landscape.<br>

The need for modernization is clear. A revamped portfolio website is essential to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements effectively. I aim to create a visually striking and user-friendly site that not only reflects my design and development abilities but also tells a compelling story about my journey and expertise.<br>

Therefor, an effort to revamp my portfolio website is needed and thus, here you are reading this :)
